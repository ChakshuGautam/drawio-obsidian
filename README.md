# Obsidian draw.io Plugin

This is a drawio plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md). It introduces diagrams that can be included within existing notes or as stand-alone files. Diagrams are created as SVG files (although .drawio extensions are also supported).

## Issues

Unfortunately the draw.io codebase is a bit of a mess, so I've been limited in my ability to integrate it as seamlessly as I would like for fear of instability. It also carries a some redundant code (like integration with dropbox, gitlab, etc) that all gets bundled into the plugin.

There are almost certainly bugs so please use this with caution.

## Contribution

Any contributions are very welcome.
